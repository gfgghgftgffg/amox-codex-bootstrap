# amox-codex-bootstrap — Pi

Give this file or repository to Pi on a new computer and ask:

> Read setup_for_pi.md, configure this computer accordingly, verify the installation, and report the results.

This is a task brief for Windows, macOS, and Linux, based on the user's current Pi installation. Complete the setup rather than handing the user commands. Read current upstream instructions and choose commands for the actual OS, architecture, shell, and host version.

## General Approach

- Check before installing; reuse compatible installations. Avoid duplicate packages, Skills, roles, and instruction blocks.
- Back up files before editing. Preserve unrelated user instructions, packages, credentials, and configuration; do not replace a whole agent directory.
- Respect `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` (default `~/.pi/agent`) and each package's effective configuration paths.
- Install the latest releases; do not pin package versions. Check compatibility and report unsupported features instead of silently changing the requested behavior.
- Keep secrets, sessions, caches, backups, and generated runtime records out of this repository and reports.
- Missing credentials or models must not block independent steps. Do not make paid model calls, upload private files, or launch agents merely to verify setup.
- Fetch the referenced [pi/ files](pi/README.md) from this repository if working from this document alone.

## 1. Pi, Conda, and Dependencies

Reuse compatible Pi, Node.js, Git, and shell installations. If Pi is absent, follow the [official installation instructions](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi). Install the latest release and verify its current requirements; Node.js 22.19 or newer is required by the current packages. The documented npm alternative is `npm install -g --ignore-scripts @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`. Verify `pi --version` and the shell actually used by Pi, including supported Bash availability on Windows.

Find Conda through PATH, environment variables, and common installation locations. If missing, install the appropriate official Miniforge release into a user-owned directory and verify its download. Do not replace system Python.

Reuse the Conda environment `codex`, shared with Codex. Create it with Python 3.12 if absent; retain an existing compatible version. **Use this environment for all Python execution and dependencies**, never system Python, base, or `pip --user`. Use its interpreter for pip and scripts, for example `conda run -n codex python -m pip ...`.

Check that `pypdf` imports and install it only if missing. Install other dependencies only when required by the packages or Skills below, preferring Conda where supported or an official user-level installation.

## 2. Pi Packages

Install these **9 user-level packages** through Pi, for example `pi install npm:@ssk_dev/pi-subagents-lean`, without `--local`. Use the package order in [pi/settings.json](pi/settings.json), preserving unrelated declarations. Do not also copy their entrypoints into extension discovery directories.

| Package source | Purpose / source |
| --- | --- |
| `npm:@indexyz/pi-provider-sub2api` | Relay provider and model discovery; [source](https://github.com/5aaee9/pi-agent-extensions/tree/main/pi-provider-sub2api) |
| `npm:@narumitw/pi-btw` | Side conversation; [source](https://github.com/narumiruna/pi-extensions/tree/main/packages/pi-btw) |
| `npm:pi-open-tui` | Terminal interface; [source](https://github.com/OldSuns/pi-open-tui) |
| `npm:@narumitw/pi-statusline` | Status line; [source](https://github.com/narumiruna/pi-extensions/tree/main/packages/pi-statusline) |
| `npm:@heyhuynhgiabuu/pi-pretty` | Tool/transcript presentation; [source](https://github.com/heyhuynhgiabuu/pi-pretty) |
| `npm:@ssk_dev/pi-web-access-lean` | Search, fetch and source checking through `web_access`; [source](https://github.com/kunkun9527/pi-web-access-lean) |
| `npm:@ssk_dev/rpiv-todo-lean` | Task tracking through `todo`; [source](https://github.com/kunkun9527/rpiv-todo-lean) |
| `npm:@ssk_dev/pi-subagents-lean` | Subagents and native workflows through `subagent`; [source](https://github.com/kunkun9527/pi-subagents-lean) |
| `npm:@monotykamary/pi-retry` | Automatic retry and continuation; [source](https://github.com/monotykamary/pi-retry) |

Load only the selected lean subagent/web/todo facades. Their upstream runtime dependencies are installed automatically; do not register those dependencies or competing wrappers as additional extensions. Replace corresponding previous registrations when updating an existing setup, preserving unrelated packages.

Use `pi list` and startup diagnostics to distinguish configured, installed, and loaded packages. Restart Pi after changes. UI/footer extensions may compete for host hooks; report actual conflicts rather than silently removing packages.

### Provider and Retry Setup

- Use [pi/sub2api.json](pi/sub2api.json) as the relay configuration template. Deploy it to `<agent-dir>/sub2api.json`, keeping `YOUR_API_KEY` as the placeholder unless a valid token already exists. Do not ask the user to send the key or fill it in yourself. In the final report, tell the user to edit the deployed file's `sub2api.token` themselves, giving its actual absolute path. Do not enable paid priority modes or hosted tools for setup.
- The lean web package exposes one `web_access` tool for search/check/fetch/get/help. Follow its current provider setup, reusing credentials or supported keyless paths. Tool registration alone does not prove authenticated search works. Do not install optional video/browser tools unless requested.
- `pi-retry` uses its defaults; this snapshot adds no `piRetry` overrides. It owns retries while loaded and disables the host's native retry scheduler. Check `/retry status` without intentionally failing model calls. Retries and output-limit auto-continuation may create additional billed turns; do not add another retry scheduler or test these with paid requests.

## 3. Skills

Install these **six user Skills** into `<agent-dir>/skills/`, or reuse complete discoverable copies without duplicate registration. Include scripts, references, and assets, not just `SKILL.md`. Keep needed source checkouts in stable user-owned directories.

| User Skill | Source | Requirements |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `design-taste-frontend` | https://github.com/Leonxlnx/taste-skill | Install the primary Skill, currently `skills/taste-skill/`, using its frontmatter name. Optional variants are not requested. |
| `humanizer` | https://github.com/blader/humanizer | Include the full Skill and referenced resources. |
| `meeting-summary-html` | https://github.com/gfgghgftgffg/meeting-summary-html | Include `scripts/prepare_meeting_input.py` and references; run helpers with the `codex` interpreter. |
| `shuorenhua` | https://github.com/MrGeDiao/shuorenhua | Include the full Skill and reference files. |
| `task-routing` | https://github.com/gfgghgftgffg/task-router | Generate with the Pi installer in section 5, not a Codex bundle. |
| `grilling` | https://github.com/mattpocock/skills/blob/main/docs/productivity/grilling.md | Documentation URL; install the actual Skill, currently `skills/productivity/grilling/`. |

After downloading `grilling` and `meeting-summary-html`, add `disable-model-invocation: true` below `description` in each installed `SKILL.md`, inside the opening `---` block. If the field already exists, set it to `true`. Invoke them explicitly with `/skill:grilling` or `/skill:meeting-summary-html`; do not add an automatic interview trigger to AGENTS.md. Generated `task-routing` is also explicit-only.

Text meeting preparation requires no ASR key. Media transcription requires `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY`; report missing credentials without blocking text summaries, and do not upload media for verification.

Verify all six intended Skills and their resources, allowing preserved unrelated Skills.

## 4. Fixed Settings and Plugin Configurations

Merge [pi/settings.json](pi/settings.json) into the effective global settings, merging packages by identity and preserving unrelated keys. Apply these requested preferences:

- `defaultProvider`: `sub2api`
- `defaultModel`: `gpt-6.1-sol`
- `defaultThinkingLevel`: `medium`
- `enabledModels`: `["sub2api/*"]`
- `tuiMode`: `fullscreen`; `theme`: `dark`

Keep these personal defaults and report missing models/providers or unsupported thinking levels; do not substitute another model. Preserve other provider credentials even though `enabledModels` scopes model selection to Sub2API. Do not copy machine-generated `lastChangelogVersion` or a local version pin.

Back up and apply these fixed non-sensitive configurations. On a fresh installation copy them verbatim; otherwise replace template-owned values while recursively preserving unrelated object keys. Arrays are complete requested values, not append-only lists.

| Fixed source | Effective target |
| --- | --- |
| [pi/open-tui.json](pi/open-tui.json) | `<agent-dir>/open-tui.json` |
| [pi/pi-btw.json](pi/pi-btw.json) | `<agent-dir>/pi-btw.json` |
| [pi/subagents.json](pi/subagents.json) | `<agent-dir>/subagents.json` |
| [pi/sub2api.json](pi/sub2api.json) | `<agent-dir>/sub2api.json`; preserve existing credentials, otherwise leave `YOUR_API_KEY` for the user to edit |

For `sub2api.json`, `YOUR_API_KEY` is a placeholder, not a usable token. If it remains, report the provider as pending and tell the user to edit `sub2api.token` in the deployed file themselves. Continue independent setup steps without waiting for the key.

Apply the full [pi/subagents.json](pi/subagents.json) configuration. It combines this computer's global defaults and project-scoped preferences for use as global defaults on the new computer. Key settings include `maxConcurrent: 50` for direct background agents, `showModel: true` to display their effective model/thinking, `fallbackSubagent: "none"`, `strictAgentFiles: true`, and `workflowsEnabled: true`. `maxConcurrentForeground: 0` and `defaultMaxTurns: 0` mean unlimited. Project `.pi/subagents.json` overrides global fields; report effective differences. Restart Pi after configuration and role changes.

BTW selects `sub2api/gpt-6.1-sol` with `thinkingLevel: "medium"`; verify its selection separately from the main model. Keep the requested value and report any unsupported thinking level. No package-source patches or runtime evidence directories need migration.

## 5. Task Router for Pi

Read the current [Task Router README](https://github.com/gfgghgftgffg/task-router) and [Pi adapter documentation](https://github.com/gfgghgftgffg/task-router/blob/main/docs/pi.md). Its executor is **`@ssk_dev/pi-subagents-lean` over `@tintinweb/pi-subagents`**. Install that facade and the lean web package first. Search roles now use `web_access` directly.

Keep the source checkout and a working copy of [pi/routing.toml](pi/routing.toml) in a stable user-owned directory. It records the installed role-map models, selection hints, 30 requested concurrent children, and five repair follow-ups. Verify `deepseek-flash`, `gpt-6.1-sol`, and `gpt-6-astra` and their exact Pi thinking support without paid generation. Omitted providers inherit the actual parent provider; do not rely on fuzzy matching, provider fallback, or clamping.

From the Router checkout, use the actual absolute configuration path:

```text
npm ci
node cli.mjs doctor --host pi --config <absolute-routing-config>
node cli.mjs install --host pi --config <absolute-routing-config>
node cli.mjs install --host pi --config <absolute-routing-config> --apply
```

Respect `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, or pass a matching `--pi-home`. Preserve installer backups, manifests, and conflict protections. The installer generates **flat `agents/tr_*.md`**, the complete `skills/task-routing/`, and one `pi-task-router` AGENTS block. It handles previously managed layouts through its manifest; do not bypass conflicts or hand-edit generated files. Keep Codex and Pi homes separate.

Generated roles deliberately do not pin model/thinking in frontmatter: the role map is authoritative. Every fresh direct launch must supply exact `model: "provider/id"` and separate `thinking` in the lean tool's JSON input; native workflow `agent()` uses `agentType`, `model`, and `effort`. Do not append a thinking suffix to the model ID. Project role overrides may change effective tools or lock model fields, so check them before dispatch. Replaced child prompts do not inherit AGENTS.md: the parent must supply applicable instructions in the brief.

Use `/agents` and `subagent({ op: "help", input: "run" })` to inspect loaded types and schema without launching children. Use `pi --list-models` for available IDs; it does not prove thinking support. `doctor` is offline/static: without a verified credential-free registry snapshot, model availability and thinking remain `UNVERIFIED`. Supply `--catalog` only from actual host metadata, never a fabricated list. Confirm search-role selectors expose `ext:pi-web-access-lean/web_access` and prohibit shell/mutation tools; registration in the parent alone is not proof of child loading.

Task Router uses **lean's native `subagent` operation `workflow`**. Native workflows use `agent()/parallel()/pipeline()` and run in the background. Their host concurrency cap is independent of direct background agents' `maxConcurrent: 50` pool; the Router's own maximum and stricter host limits still apply.

Restart Pi or `/reload` after installing roles, then activate only when requested with `/skill:task-routing`. Installation does not authorize delegation. Pi's `-p` is print mode, not a profile flag. The Router's recommended orchestrator (`gpt-6-astra`, `medium`) does not change the normal Pi default (`gpt-6.1-sol`, `medium`).

## 6. Fixed Global AGENTS.md

Use [pi/AGENTS.md](pi/AGENTS.md), not the Codex [templates/AGENTS.md](templates/AGENTS.md). Substitute only these verified absolute paths:

- `{{CONDA_PATH}}`: Conda executable.
- `{{PYTHON_PATH}}`: the `codex` environment's Python interpreter.

Check effective global context-file precedence, including `AGENTS.override.md`. On a fresh installation render the template verbatim after dependencies and Router installation. Otherwise back up and update corresponding quality, Python, proxy, Requirement Alignment, Workflow, and router entries, preserving unrelated instructions and exactly one Pi router block. Do not paraphrase or add a Skill inventory or automatic interview rule.

Retain installer-managed block protections. If a newer Router changes its policy block, report the discrepancy rather than blindly overwriting it. Do not render unresolved paths or claim missing dependencies are installed. Use the recorded proxy `127.0.0.1:7897` only when available and network access is failing or slow; do not force a permanent system proxy.

## 7. Verification and Report

1. Verify Pi, Node, Git, shell, and the `codex` interpreter with a successful `pypdf` import.
2. Verify all 9 package declarations, resources, and startup diagnostics, including the lean `subagent`, `web_access`, and `todo` tools and `/retry status`. Check for duplicate facades; distinguish installed from loaded.
3. Verify six user Skills with resources. Confirm `grilling` and `meeting-summary-html` have `disable-model-invocation: true`, and explicit Skill commands remain available.
4. Run the meeting preparation helper on a temporary local text fixture without ASR or uploads.
5. Parse deployed JSON and compare template-owned values with [pi/](pi/README.md), excluding real credential values from comparisons and reports. If the Sub2API token remains `YOUR_API_KEY`, report it as pending and give the user the deployed file's absolute path and the `sub2api.token` field to edit; do not collect or populate the key. Verify subagent concurrency, model display, fallback/strict-file/workflow settings and both main-model and BTW `medium` thinking. Distinguish saved defaults, model metadata, and live operation.
6. Verify flat Router roles, their references and tool selectors, exact model/thinking policies, and one Pi AGENTS block. Distinguish static `doctor` success from runtime support; do not dispatch children or paid inference merely for verification.
7. Compare global instructions with the rendered template; check no unresolved placeholders, duplicate blocks, or automatic interview trigger. Preserve unrelated instructions and confirm repeated setup does not duplicate registrations.

Report each item as newly installed, reused, pending configuration, or failed, including effective paths, installed versions, source commits, saved defaults, and restart/activation requirements. Give concrete blockers and next steps. Do not describe static checks or partial setup as full operational success.
